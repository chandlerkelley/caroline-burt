		<div class="about-box">
			<p>Caroline Burt is a multi-talented personality with careers in music, television, and fashion.</p>

			<p>At the age of 19, she interned under renowned DJ, Skrillex, and became fascinated with the EDM world - gravitating towards becoming a DJ herself.</p>

			<p>After enrolling in UCLA School of Music Business, she began working at the Kardashian family owned DASH Boutique. Her penchant for the entertainment industry and bad boy rockstars, clashed with her politician family on air and needless to say, she became a featured star character on DASH Dolls.</p>

			<p>After years of working as a DJ and being on television, Caroline is creating original music and plans to release her debut EP, 100 by the end of 2016. The EP features production by Matt Good and Sonny Moore (Skrillex).</p>
